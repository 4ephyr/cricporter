                <p>                    Notably, in their last game against Chennai Super Kings, Rohit came out to bat at number three but even that change didn’t work well as Deepak Chahar sent him back to the pavilion in the third over of the match itself. The Mumbai-born cricketer tried to play a scoop but failed to time it as Ravindra Jadeja picked up an easy catch in the end. With that, Rohit registered his third duck of the current season.
                </p>



                <p>Meanwhile, talking about Rohit’s performance in the game against CSK at Chepauk, former India batter Krishnamachari Srikkanth took a swipe at him during commentary, and called him ‘No hit Sharma’. The 63-year-old went on to add that he wouldn’t have even played him in the XI if he was the skipper of the five-time champions.
                </p>


                <p>“Not Hit Sharma". Rohit Sharma should change his name to ‘NO HIT SHARMA’, I will not even play him in XI if I was Captain of MI,” Srikkanth commented.
